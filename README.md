BrowserBee is a privacy-first open source Chrome extension that lets you control your browser using natural language. It combines the power of an LLM for instruction parsing and Playwright for robust browser automation.

Since BrowserBee runs entirely within your browser (with the exception of the LLM), it can interact with logged-in websites, like your social media accounts or email, without compromising security or requiring backend infrastructure. This makes it more convenient for personal use than other "browser use" type products out there.

## üé≤ Features 

- Supports major LLM providers such as **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, and **Gemini**, with more coming soon
- Tracks **token use** and **price** so you know how much you're spending on each task
- Has access to a wide range of **üïπÔ∏è browser tools** for interacting and understanding browser state
- Uses **Playwright** in the background which is a robust browser automation tool
- The **memory** feature captures useful tool use sequences and stores them locally to make future use more efficient
- The agent knows when to ask for user's **approval**, e.g. for purchases or posting updates on social media
