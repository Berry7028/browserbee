*Your AI-powered browser automation assistant. Control the web with natural language.*

BrowserBee is a privacy-first open source Chrome extension that lets you control your browser using natural language. It combines the power of an LLM for instruction parsing and Playwright for robust browser automation.

Since BrowserBee runs entirely within your browser (with the exception of the LLM), it can interact with logged-in websites, like your social media accounts or email, without compromising security or requiring backend infrastructure. This makes it more convenient for personal use than other "browser use" type products out there.

## üé≤ Features 

- Supports major LLM providers such as **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, and **Gemini**, with more coming soon
- Tracks **token use** and **price** so you know how much you're spending on each task
- Has access to a wide range of **üïπÔ∏è browser tools** for interacting and understanding browser state
- Uses **Playwright** in the background which is a robust browser automation tool
- The **memory** feature captures useful tool use sequences and stores them locally to make future use more efficient
- The agent knows when to ask for user's **approval**, e.g. for purchases or posting updates on social media

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

- **Social media butler**: Checks your social media accounts, summarizes notifications and messages, and helps you respond.
- **News curator**: Gathers and summarizes the latest headlines from your preferred news sources and blogs, giving you a quick, personalized briefing.
- **Personal assistant**: Helps with everyday tasks like reading and sending emails and messages, booking flights, finding products, and more.
- **Research assistant**: Assists with deep dives into topics like companies, job listings, market trends, and academic publications by gathering and organizing information.
- **Knowledge bookmarking & summarization**: Quickly summarizes articles, extracts key information, and saves useful insights for later reference.

## üõ´ Roadmap

Please refer to [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for an up to date list of features we're aiming to add to BrowserBee. 

- Support for saving and replaying sessions (macros)
- Ability to memorize key information as needed (in your local Chrome instance using [IndexedDB](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/indexeddb))
- Scheduled task execution (e.g. check news and social media every morning)

If you're interested in contributing to build any of these features or to improve BrowserBee in any way, please head over to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
